Welcome, fellow hacker!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to uncover the hidden flag within this web application.

The goal is to exploit a vulnerability to retrieve a secret payload from the database. This challenge requires you to think beyond the obvious.

Initial Clues:

The front-end is a simple search form. What happens when you submit a query?

A common web vulnerability involves the manipulation of a database query. A single apostrophe ' can be a good starting point.

The flag is not in a single piece. It has been broken into multiple parts and is stored in a separate location. You will need to find all the pieces.

The flag pieces are not in the correct order. You will need to reassemble them to get the final flag.

The flag is a Base64 encoded string.

Good luck, and happy hunting.
